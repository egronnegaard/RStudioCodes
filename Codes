# Chapter 1:

## Creating a ggplot:
* geom_"style", there are more than 30 types to choose from, use google to find the appropriate
* ggplot(data = choice) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = choiceofx, y = choiceofy, size = sizeofvar, color = colorclassification, linetype = choice))

## Facet Wraps: splitting data into several plots (facets)
* ggplot(data = choice) + geom_point(maping = aes(x = xofchoice, y = yofchoice)) + facet_wrap(~ class, nrow = choice))
* alternatively use facet_grid() for using two variables, separated by ~

## Coordinate Systems: ggplot2
* coord_flip()      # switches x-y axes
* coord_quickmap()  # sets tge aspect rtio correctily for map 
* coord_polar()     # uses polar coordinates (connection between bar and Coxcomb cgart

# Chapter 3: Data Transformation with `dplyr`
* Take carefull notes with the conflicts that are printed when a package is loaded. If there are conflicts, use the full command dplyr::functionname()

## Basics: positioning: 1) argument is a data frame, 2( describve what you want to do with the data, 3 the result is a new data frame
* filter()        # pick observations by their values
* arrange()       # reorder the rows
* select()        # pick variables by their names 
  - starts_with("abc")    # matches names that begin with "abc"
  - ends_with("abc")      # matches names that end with "abc"
  - contains("abc")       # matches bamnes that contain "abc"
  - matches("(.)//1")     # selects variables that match a regular expression
  - num_arrange("x", 1:3) # matches x1, x2, and x3
* mutate()        # create new variables with functions of existing vcariables
  - transmute()           # if you only want to keep the new variable
* summarize()     # collapse manu values down to a signle summary
  -  na.rm = TRUE         # removes na's before computation
* is.na()         # determine uf a value is missing

## Useful Summary Functions
* mean()            # compute average
* median()          # compute median
* sd()              # spread: standard deviation
* IQR()             # spread: interquartile range
* mad()             # spread: median absolute deviation
* min()             # minimum
* max()             # maximum
* quantile(x, 0.25) # quartiles
* first()           # first value of variable
* nth(x. 2)         # n'th value of variable (here 2nd)
* last()            # last value of variable
* n()               # size of the current group
* sum(!is.na())     # number of non-missing vlues
* n_distinct()      # coybt the number of destinct values in a given variable

### Chunk for standardizing per group metrics
popular_dataset %>% 
  filter(something > 0) %>%
  mutatae(prop_something = something / sum(something)) %>%
  select(material of interest)

## Grouping by Multiple Variables: each summary peels of one level of the grouping
* group_by(xvar, yvar, zvar, etc)
* ungroup()                       # remove grouping, and return operations on ungrouped data!
